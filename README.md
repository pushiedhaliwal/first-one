<h2> ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h2>
I created this website so that I can help all the students trying to find the first job 
and to set up an open forum to add projects from various other authors to serve as refreshers or additional
content information to help better prepare on the first day of the job.

<p>About me all i can say is the journey to being an Engineer hasn't been easy. After finishing my Bachelors in Engineering I was offered a job in one of the IT firms in India but my parents had other plans. Being a girl child from an orthodox Sikh family, I couldnt simply pick up my bags and settle in any city without parental supervision so I immigrated to Canada with my mother to support my brother who was in grade 8 at the time. This wasnt the time when the immigrants education was taken at face value, which means I had to take up the odd jobs until the evaluation and upgradation of my Bachelors was in place. This wasnt an easy journey because both me and mom had a house to run as well. 
<p>Looking back I learned a lot, I was a barista at a coffee shop, sold financial products for one of the top 5 banks in Canada and was briefly an Insurance Agent as well. Fun times!! They taught me the value of hard work.

<p>After paying my dues I finally found a job with Panasonic Canada where I met my husband, he was the first person to encourage me not to get settled but move on and get my masters so after saving for a few years, had a kid in the middle somewhere, here I am sitting today in my office after completing my Masters. So to all of you out there, its not impossible to achieve anything once you have set your mind to it.
<p>Now let's move on to the real reason we are here, the projects. I am one of those people who believe in constant learning in life, hence the explanation of all sorts of projects I took on while in my master's. I wanted to diversiy and learn all that I possibly could in the limited time I was afforded during my master's.
